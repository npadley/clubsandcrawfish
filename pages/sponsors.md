# Sponsorship Opportunities

Walnut Farm Montessori School is celebrating our 25th year in Northwest Arkansas. As the only accredited Montessori school in our area, we have children ages 18 months to 9 years from diverse backgrounds, abilities, religions, races and cultures. In addition to a full Montessori Curriculum, we provide a variety of enrichment programs and activities to our students that are not available at any other school in the area. Walnut Farm Montessori is a non-profit school that relies on fundraising and strategic community partnerships to help educate the future leaders of our community.
